Project 4
CS 4760

In this project, a main exectuable ./oss will initialize, create a system clock in shared memory, and allocate a process table consisting of an array of ProcessControlBlock objects.  It will then spawn off children at semi-random intervals and they will be scheduled following a set of rules.

It will produce a log file, 'oss.log' which will contain information about the passage of time in the system and the activity of child processes (their position in queues, any io blocking, etc...)

The process will conclude with a set of statistics about wait time, time blocked (sleeping), throughput, and system idle time.  

Normal operation of the program consists of using the command './oss' after the project has been made.  The executable can also be invoked with the command line argument -h, although it sparse as no other command line arguments are accepted.

The code is stored in a git repository, which is hosted on github.  The commit log can be found at https://github.com/adk8673/o2-kane.4/commits/master
